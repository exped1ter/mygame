## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mygame.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

3. Click "Start Game" and begin learning about microbiology through drag & drop!

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### How Drag & Drop Works:
1. **Left Column**: Static organism cards (one per row)
2. **Right Column**: Draggable characteristic cards
3. **Drag**: Click and hold on a characteristic card
4. **Drop**: Release over the matching organism card
5. **Correct Match**: Cards animate and characteristic disappears
6. **Wrong Match**: Cards shake and you lose a life

### Progressive Difficulty:
- **Level 1**: 4 characteristics to match - Easy start
- **Level 2**: 6 characteristics to match - Getting harder
- **Level 3**: 8 characteristics to match - More challenging
- **Level 4**: 10 characteristics to match - Advanced
- **Level 5**: 12 characteristics to match - Expert level (Final Level)

### Visual Feedback:
- **Drag Over**: Organism card highlights when you drag over it
- **Correct Match**: Organism card fades briefly, characteristic card disappears
- **Wrong Match**: Both cards shake with red animation
- **Level Complete**: 🎉 Celebration message when all characteristics are matched
- **Game Complete**: 🏆 Congratulations when all 5 levels are finished

### Scoring System:
- **Correct Match**: +10 points
- **Wrong Match**: -1 life
- **Level Complete**: Bonus points and new level unlocked
